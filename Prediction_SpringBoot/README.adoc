This guide walks you through the process of creating a "machine learning rest api" link:/understanding/REST[RESTful web service] with Spring.

== What you'll build

You'll build a service that will accept HTTP GET requests with the row to predict at:
----
http://localhost:8080/machinelearning?Month=10&DayofMonth=1&DayofWeek=1&DepTime=1231&Distance=730&UniqueCarrier=WN&Origin=SMF&Dest=PDX
----

and it will respond with the prediction

----
Label (aka prediction) is flight departure delayed: Flight Will Not Be Delayed
----

Changing the parameters ih the HTTP Request gives a different prediction
